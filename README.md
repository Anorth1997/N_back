This is an IOS application I built for a psychology research lab called Budding Minds Lab. It meant to help
the lab research on human's memory.

It's named N_back game. The game allows the researchers to set the levels of difficulty and 
get participantsâ€™ performance as CSV files. I created 10 default levels in the game, and the researchers
can demo any number of new levels in the application.
