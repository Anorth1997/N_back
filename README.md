This is an IOS application I built for a psychology research lab called Budding Minds Lab. It meant to help
the lab research on human's memory.

It's named Nback Game. The participants' need to memorize the details (color, sound, shape, position) of N previous stimulus they have seen, and give response if the current stimuli is the same as the N previous stimuli in any aspects. 

While the participants playing the game, their performance get traced and at the end the application will output the details of their performance as CSV files, such as response time and accuracy. Thus the reseachers can use these data as their supporting evidence. 

I created 10 default levels for the game, but the researchers can create any number of new levels in the application if they want to test the participants' memory under different circumstances.
